# Brazilian Fauna Species Separator - Rio Grande do Sul
The Brazilian Fauna Species Separator - Rio Grande do Sul is a project focused on the classification and automatic separation of images of fauna species found in the Rio Grande do Sul region, Brazil. Our goal is to facilitate the work of biologists, researchers, and wildlife enthusiasts in the identification and categorization of different species, thus contributing to the conservation of local biodiversity.

# Objective
Create an automated system for classifying images of Brazilian fauna species, focusing on those found in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
Facilitate the identification and categorization of species through image processing techniques and machine learning.
Provide an accessible and open-source tool for scholars and nature lovers to contribute data on the region's fauna.
# Features
Automatic Classification: Use machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and separate images of different species.
Open Documentation: Detailed documentation about the project, including usage instructions, information about classified species, and guidelines for contributions.
# Contribution
